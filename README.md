# Algorithmic_Trading_Platform

This program is written in Cpp and simulates a Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover trading strategy using historical market data. The program backtests the strategy across multiple assets(currently stocks) by using multithreading to run the backtest for each asset concurrently. It calculates the Return on Investment (ROI) based on a defined short-term and long-term moving average window. 

Not enough data for it to be viable, strategy also needs to be tuned. Still in process!!!
